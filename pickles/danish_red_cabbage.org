** Ingredients

| Red cabbage |      1 | kg        |

** Recipe 

Finely slice the cabbage and add it to a pot.  
Add the sugar, salt, and vinegar to the pot and let it simmer gently for 30 minutes and stir occasionally. 
It is likely not needed but if it is after 30 min add a tiny bit of water (<50 ml). 
Simmer for 1 hour stir once in a while. 

Now put everything in a jar and seal it. Wait 2-3 days before consuming, this is done to let the flavours settle.
